No. The given bracket sequence is not correct because a closing bracket "]" and an opening bracket "(" has no pair.
To make it correct, they should get pairs, some variants are possible:
- add matching pairs: add an opening bracket "[" and a closing bracket ")" to match the sequence
- delete unmatched brackets: remove brackets without pair - "]" and "("
- adjust brackets:
    > add the opening bracket "[" and delete the extra opening bracket "("
    > add the closing bracket ")" and delete the extra closing bracket "]"
